NOISe builds on top of [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) for the task of osteoclast instance segmentation. This repository contains training, validation, and inference scripts to train an instance segmentation model from scratch and finetune on top of the provided checkpoints trained for osteoclast and nuclei detection as proposed in our [paper]().

<summary>Install</summary>

Pip install the ultralytics package including all [requirements](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/pyproject.toml) in a [**Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment with [**PyTorch>=1.8**](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ultralytics.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ultralytics) [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/ultralytics)](https://pepy.tech/project/ultralytics)

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

For alternative installation methods including [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics), [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics), and Git, please refer to the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart).

<summary>Usage</summary>

### CLI

YOLOv8 may be used directly in the Command Line Interface (CLI) with a `yolo` command:

```bash
yolo predict model=yolov8n.pt source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'
```

`yolo` can be used for a variety of tasks and modes and accepts additional arguments, i.e. `imgsz=640`. See the YOLOv8 [CLI Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cli) for examples.

### Python

YOLOv8 may also be used directly in a Python environment, and accepts the same [arguments](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cfg/) as in the CLI example above:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("yolov8n.yaml")  # build a new model from scratch
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

# Use the model
model.train(data="coco128.yaml", epochs=3)  # train the model
metrics = model.val()  # evaluate model performance on the validation set
results = model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")  # predict on an image
path = model.export(format="onnx")  # export the model to ONNX format
```

See YOLOv8 [Python Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/python) for more examples.
