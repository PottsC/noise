NOISe builds on top of [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) for the task of osteoclast instance segmentation. This repository contains training, validation, and inference scripts to train an instance segmentation model from scratch and finetune on top of the provided checkpoints trained for osteoclast and nuclei detection as proposed in our [paper]().

## Dataset
Our dataset consists of full slide images and corresponding instance segmentation annotations, along with patches used for training and validation in our experiments. Please download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hwGVKH4pN1Ftcl9bDKUykTIU8mcZfmiu?usp=drive_link), unzip the data and place it in the dataset folder with the following folder structure:

```
noise
    |...
    |-- dataset
        |-- m1
            |-- images
            |-- labels
        |-- m2
            |-- images
            |-- labels
        |...
        |-- m5
            |-- images
            |-- labels
    |...
```

## Whole Slide Inference
Instance segmentation prediction can be done for a whole slide image by creating overlapping patches of ```832x832``` resolution, that are then merged to generate a full-scale output. Different models trained on various configurations of data are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pHpwhwJSKN47Dbtcy92F2XHydpURMb4O?usp=drive_link).

```
python wsi_inference.py path/to/checkpoint.pt path/to/images
```

Outputs will be stored in ```path/to/output```.

## Training
Training from scratch or finetuning a specific checkpoint can be done using the following command:

```
python train.py --ckpt path/to/checkpoint.pt
```

## Validation
Running evaluation on test data can be done using the following command:

```
python val.py --ckpt path/to/checkpoint.pt
```

## Training on your data
NOISe can be further improved by training on custom data following these steps:

### Preparing dataset
We provide a helper script to convert whole slide images into overlapping patches of a fixed size for training and validation of models.

```
python create_patches.py --img_foldername path/to/wsi_imagefolder --roi_foldername path/to/imageJ_rois --out_foldername path/to/patch_folder
```

### Configs
Update the config.yaml according to the dataset created:
```
path: path/to/patch_data
train: [train_folder1, train_folder2, ...]
val: [test_folder1, test_folder2, ...]
```

### Train
Once the dataset is generated, and the `config.yaml` file is adjusted accordingly, training can be done using:

```
python train.py --ckpt path/to/checkpoint.pt --data config.yaml
```
